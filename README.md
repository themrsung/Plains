# Plains

Plains is a Java library which provides a wide range of utilities and a solid
architecture to build an application for any purpose.

This is a personal library which I use for my projects. Thus, I probably won't
accept any contributions. You can fork the repository and do whatever you want
with it if you really like it.

The documentation may not be up-to-date.

If you really like the current state of this library, clone it and keep a personal copy.
**I frequently nuke my projects.** (as in deleting every file and starting from scratch)
